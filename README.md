# AfterMeal

Thailand is one of the countries that has a food-sharing culture, where meals are often shared. However, not every dish is favorable to everyone, and dietary restrictions are common. So it's a usual case to have more than one sharing circle within a single meal, and sometimes people find it inconvenient to calculate their fair share. But not anymore, AfterMeal is here to solve the problem. With AfterMeal, the user can effortlessly add food items, assign them to individuals, adjust rules like VAT and discounts, and then the calculation is done! Developed primarily with SwiftUi, AfterMeal allows the user to add food items with their price and category. Users can add names, pick what they eat from the food list added, and select a group for reference. Lastly, the rules can be customized with 4 rules available including VAT, Service Charge, Discount, and Sponsor. After all information is input, the result of fair shares is ready! 

After meal is an iOS application project that had been submitted to Swift Student Challenge 2024. It's also my first iOS application ever created. I only had been familiar with SwiftUI for around 3 months before begining the project. There was many limitations regarding to the challange specifications, but my main concerns were that the app had to be able to perform an intended task under 3 minutes, and core data was not available in Swift Playground template. Eventually, I made AfterMeal without core data, and I supposed that people could use it under 3 minutes. It took me around 10 days of hard work from a design to an implementation. I had so much fun during the project except the parts when I was struggling with the code. 

This is a former design concept of AfterMeal, but in latest version, I intended to use more orginal designs and code from Apple resulting in a bit different outcome.

I captured some screens from the real application running on preview of XCode. You can find them in the folder.
